### 1. Introduction
Ambient Mesh is a new Istio data plane mode that’s designed for simplified operations, broader application compatibility, and reduced infrastructure cost. Ambient mesh gives users the option to forgo sidecar proxies in favor of a mesh data plane that’s integrated into their infrastructure, all while maintaining Istio’s core features of zero-trust security, telemetry, and traffic management.

The Ambient Mesh Project offers a different approach to managing microservices, standing out as better alternative to traditional service mesh architectures by significantly reducing complexity and resource overhead. Unlike service meshes that rely on sidecar proxies, Ambient Mesh simplifies application architecture, leading to enhanced performance, improved observability, and easier operational management. This streamlined method not only cuts down on CPU and memory consumption but also accelerates service-to-service communication, making it an efficient and scalable solution for modern distributed systems.
